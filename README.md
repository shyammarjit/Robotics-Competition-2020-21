# Robotics-Competition-2020-21
# Theme: Vitarana Drone
This Project is going on. This is basically an E-Yantra Robotics Competition 2020-21. In this, we get the project, Vitarana Drone. In this theme, I learned concepts of control systems, path planning, image processing and algorithm development. To implement the several tasks I used tools such as the Robot Operating System, robotics simulator Gazebo, the Python programming language and many of its libraries. The competition is conducted as a series of tasks, our final problem statement is for the drone to deliver various packages to their destinations, optimizing for time and quantity.
