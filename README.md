This Project is going on. Thsi is bacically a E-Yantra Robotics Competition 2020-21. In this we get the project Vitarana Drone. In this theme, I learned concepts of control systems, path planning, image processing and algorithm development. To implement the several taskes I used tools such as the Robot Operating System, robotics simulator Gazebo, the Python programming language and many of its libraries.The competition is conducted as a series of tasks, your final problem statement is for the drone to deliver various packages to their destinations, optimizing for time and quantity.
